# Quick Start Template with React Router

This repository serves as a **boilerplate template** designed to quickly launch any React project or exercise that requires managing navigation between different views or pages.

It comes pre-configured with the latest features of **[React Router DOM](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/overview)**, allowing you to focus directly on your application's logic without the hassle of initial routing setup.

## Key Features

* **Base Setup:** Ready-to-run project with React and Vite.
* **Minimalist and Simple Design:** The template is intentionally very simple and lightweight. It only includes **two pre-configured and routed example views** to showcase the basic navigation mechanism, without complex styling.
* **Integrated React Router:** Initial configuration file for the `Router` in `Layout.jsx`.
